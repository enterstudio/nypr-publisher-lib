#### `content-types`
These components are used to render the content proxied to by an `api-response`. The `model` passed into each of these will be an `api-response` model, and the component is configured to pull out the appropriate attributes to use for rendering.

Remember, an `api-response` is an `ember-data` model with an attribute that points to **another** `ember-data` model.

##### `about-page`
So let's say we have an `about-page` model with the following attributes.
"}}
{{code-snippet name="about-page.js"}}
{{md-text text="
The `api-response` model that is passed into the `about-page` component could be defined like so:
"}}
{{code-snippet name="about-page-api-response.js"}}

{{md-text text="
And the `about-page` component will be rendered out like this:
"}}
{{code-snippet name="about-page-component.hbs"}}

{{md-text text="###### About"}}
{{!-- BEGIN-SNIPPET about-page-component --}}
{{about-page model=model.aboutApiResponse}}
{{!-- END-SNIPPET --}}

##### `tease-list`
The `tease-list` component renders out an `api-response` that has a `teaseList` attribute, which is just a list of `story` models.

So let's say we have an `api-response` defined like so with a list of `story` models set as its `teaseList` property:
"}}
{{code-snippet name="tease-list-api-response.js"}}

{{md-text text="
The `story-list` component is rendered like so, accepting the `api-response` model as its `model` parameter:
"}}
{{code-snippet name="story-list-component.hbs"}}

{{!-- BEGIN-SNIPPET story-list-component --}}
{{story-list model=model.listApiResponse}}
{{!-- END-SNIPPET --}}
